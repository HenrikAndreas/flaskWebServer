This project is a Python and Flask driven Web Server. It's meant for my own personal use. It contains a login system,
and possibility to create an account. It's hosted on an Raspberry Pi, and the RPi.GPIO module is activated, so that
through the website, one could turn on / off an electronic device connected to the Rapsberry Pi.

To Do:
- Add registration
- Add camera-livestream
- Possibility to post
- Userdata and post storage
- Logout function
- Flask logger
